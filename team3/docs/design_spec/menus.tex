\section{Menu Bar}



\subsection{Introduction}

{This specification document illustrates the base features of the intended Menu bar of the new Tower of Lights editor. The bar contains numerous features that are similarto the existing UI with a few additions. The descriptions of the sections are listed as follows.}

\subsection{Features and Descriptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{File}

{This drop-down list deals with IO manipulation. Features include:}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{New} - Creates a new blank project. Currently, the frames are loaded with a single start, so this is a future improvement.
	\item \textbf{Open} - Opens an existing .tan2 file for editing.
	\item \textbf{Save} - Saves file.
	\item \textbf{Save As} - Similar to traditional "Save As" option.  This is not a core feature, but could be implemented.
	\item \textbf{Close} - Closes window.   This is not core functionality, and would be added if time allows.  The window already has a close button provided, which renders this a convenience.


	\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Works}

{These features will not be present in the first few iterations of the software; however, if time permits should be implemented.  The playback features are important features that are, if not core functionality, a must for additional functionality. }

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Edit}

{This drop-down list displays options for editing the document at a frame-level (rearrange, delete, insert, clear, ...) and cell-level (individual box). For some of these functionalities - Insert, Delete, Copy ... - short-cut icons will be available on the editor window.  This section is also not required core functionality.  As much of it is implemented elsewhere, and what is not is also additional features.  Therefore, this will only be added if time permits.}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Insert} - Insert a frame before or after current frame.
	\item \textbf{Delete} - Delete current frame.
	\item \textbf{Clear} - Clear entire frame.
	\item \textbf{Clear Cell} - Clear LED selection of a specific cell.
	\item \textbf{Randomize} - Fill a frame with random combinations of colors and shades.
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Tools}

{This drop-down list will include all the tool-boxes that the editor will be using including a checkbox option for users to check-off tools that they desire to have present in the editor window. Tool boxes include:}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Frame toolbox}
	\item \textbf{LED toolbox}

	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Search}

{This option will enable users to search for a specific frame by label or frame number.  Again, this is an additional feature to be added as time permits.}

\item \textbf{Playback}

{This drop-down list will be used to play, pause, or stop the various animations created within an open file. Options include: }
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Play/Pause} - Play or pause an animation.
	\item \textbf{Stop} - Stops an animation and resets frame location to the beginning.
	\item \textbf{Preview Mode} -Plays animation in a new window with pictorial representation of the Tower building.

	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Animations}

{This feature will be added under "Edit". The purpose of this feature is to enable users to select from a list of built-in animations (snake, sine wave, ...) and specify the number of frames to be used upon creation of animations. Due to lack of time and presence of features with higher-priorities, implementation of this feature will take place in the very late stages of development, as time permits. }

\end{itemize}
