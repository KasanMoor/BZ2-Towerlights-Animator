\noindent \textbf{To}  Bruce Bolden \newline \textbf{From}  Zachary Spence \newline \textbf{Subject}  Homework 4: Report on Design Spec with Team\\\\
\textbf{Introduction}\\
These are the results on my work with my team, Group 4, on HW4.\\

\noindent \textbf{Overview}\\
My task was the creation of that part of the Design Specification that was responsible for detailing the output of our project and how it will appear.\\

\noindent \textbf{Summary}\\
To summarize my efforts: After the team met and detailed a), what we felt the interface design should be; b) what we felt the core functionality and the additional improvements would be; and c) who would have what section of the design specification.  My task was the output section.  In this section, I had to provide what the .tan2 file required and what then our program had to provide.  This included detailing each piece of the header, and the entire format required for each frame.  Then it was just a simple matter of typing it up in a memorandum.\\
