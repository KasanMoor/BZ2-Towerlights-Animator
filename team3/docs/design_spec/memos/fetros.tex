	\textbf{Subject:} Rough Draft of Design Spec \newline
	\textbf{Date:} 11/1/2016 	\newline\newline
	\textbf{Introduction} \newline
	This memo outlines the work I did in conjunction with the rest of my team to create the first draft of the design specification.. \newline\newline
	\textbf{Overview}\newline
	We met as a team and decided what we wanted to include in the design spec and who would write each part of the specification and functionalities that would be contained within. we then used GitHub to submit our individual parts\newline\newline
	\textbf{Summary}\newline
	For my portion of the design specification I wrote about the ToolBox and the different tabs that would be contained within it. I wrote about the color tab and also the editing tab. I also included possible future functionality when it came to things we wanted to add but were not part of what we deemed the core functionality.
