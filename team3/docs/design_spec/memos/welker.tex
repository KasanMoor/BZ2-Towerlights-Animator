	\textbf{Introduction} \newline
	This is a memo summarizing my contribution towards the first draft of my teams design specifications document. \newline\newline
	\textbf{Overview}\newline
	In order to complete this document our team needed to meet together to discus ideas. After having a little over an hour long meeting we were able to get some basic ideas of what we 			wanted to do as well as divide tasks between the group members.\newline\newline
	\textbf{Summary}\newline
	For my portion of the design spec. I was assigned the general part. General consisted of our teams goals, development plans, timeline, and flowcharts that would help show some of how 			we want the program to function. For this I had to learn how to use tikz in order to make the flowcharts and even included a picture representation of our timeline. The flowcharts I decided   	do where ones that showed some user interaction with the program. This is because we don't fully have the design for the application finished yet just mostly the higher level ideas. As 			such its easier to show how we plan to create this application by how the user uses it.
